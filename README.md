# Web Based Instruction Set Simulator
This was done as the Bachelors thesis project for the Computer Engineering program in the Faculty of Engineering at Yeditepe University. This was done for an user to be able to see how an instruction set simulator works, the way the instructions sets are translated from C code into assembly code, the changes in the memory,and how they would occur in the hardware. For this purpose we built a web based instruction set simulator that students can use for learning. This was a part of the project that was done for the TÜBİTAK(Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey) of Professor Sezer Gören Uğurdağ and associated persons.
